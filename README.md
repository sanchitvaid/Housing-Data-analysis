while buying a house. 
Seggergated the source data in to numerical(continuous) and categorical(discrete) dataframes and used pearson correlation method to find out the correlation amongst the numerical data.
Used OneHot Encoding to prepare the the categorical dataframe for further testing.
Determined the P-Value and performed the Chi square test on the categorical fields to finally realise what are the important variable fiedls that are highly correlated to our target field(sale price)
